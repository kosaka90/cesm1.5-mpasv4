Experimental code to port the dynamical core MPASv4 to the Community Earth System Model version 1.5.
This code version was developed by collaborative efforts by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) 
Mesoscale & Microscale Meteorology laboratory, NCAR Climate & Global Dynamics laboratory, and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.

       See the CESM web site for documentation and information.

The most current process for updating and testing CESM versions is documented in a shared
NCAR/UCAR google document at:
